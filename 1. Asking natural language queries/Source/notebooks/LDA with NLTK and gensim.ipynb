a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the ai to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its \"object model\" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.\\n\\n=== motion and manipulation ===ai is heavily used infor millions of years.=== social intelligence ===moravec\\'s paradox can be extended to many forms of social intelligence.in the long run, social skills and an understanding of human emotion ands are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; this tends to give naive users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.=== general intelligence ===historically, projects such as the cyc knowledge base (1984–) and the massive japanesemay someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.many of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence, if machines are to solve the problems as well as people do. for example, even specific straightforward tasks, like\", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\\n\\n== approaches ==\\nthere is no established unifying theory or?\\ncan intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as)? or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?\\n\\n=== cybernetics and brain simulation ===in the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection betweenin england. by 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\\n\\n=== symbolic ===when access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, ai research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. the research was centered in three institutions:.\\nresearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine withand considered this the goal of their field.\\n\\n==== cognitive simulation ====\\neconomistarchitecture in the middle 1980s.\\n\\n==== logic-based ====\\nunlike simon and newell,.\\n\\n==== anti-logic or scruffy ====\\nresearchers at) are an example of \"scruffy\" ai, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.\\n\\n====knowledge-based====\\nwhen computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build), the first truly successful form of ai software. the knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple ai applications.\\n\\n=== sub-symbolic ===\\nby the 1980s progress in symbolic ai seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially. a number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific ai problems. sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.\\n\\n==== embodied intelligence ====\\nthis includes: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\\n\\nwithin, developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).====computational intelligence and soft computing====\\ninterest in.\\n\\n=== statistical learning ===\\nmuch of traditional gofai got bogged down on \\'\\'ad hoc\\'\\' patches to symbolic computation that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. however, around the 1990s, ai researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as. in agi research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into gofai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.=== integrating the approaches ===\\n;intelligent agent paradigm: anand economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents. building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration;

irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. in all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. the time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. in contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about ethics.\"machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. a variety of perspectives of this nascent

make inferences to generalize and to make analogies some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches alongside many other ai and nonai algorithmslearning algorithms work on the basis that strategies algorithms and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future these inferences can be obvious such as since the sun rose every morning

goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attentionnn reasoning problem solving nnearly researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late 1980s and 1990s ai research had developed methods for dealing withnnthese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a combinatorial explosion they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger  in fact even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research was able to model they solve most of their problems using fast

researchers care to represent there tend to be a huge number of exceptions almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires ai research has explored a number of solutions to this problemnthe breadth of commonsense knowledge the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of—they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time nthe subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally for example a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposedthese are nonconscious and subsymbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain knowledge like this informs supports and provides a context for symbolic conscious knowledge as with the related problem of subsymbolic reasoning it is hoped thatwill provide ways to represent this kind of knowledgenn planning intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them they need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize theor value of available choicesnnin classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions however if the agent is not the only actor then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty this calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessmentnn learning machine learning a fundamental concept of ai

on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines in all cases only human beings have engaged in ethical

delineated in the aaai fall  symposium on machine ethics past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines in all cases only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning the time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy necessitate this in contrast to computer hacking software property issues privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users
