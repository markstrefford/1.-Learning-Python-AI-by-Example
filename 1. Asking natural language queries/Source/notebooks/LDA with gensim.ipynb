(a generic ai has difficulty inferring whether the councilmen or the demonstrators are the ones alleged to be advocating violence.)== problems ==\\n\\n\\nthe overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. the general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. the traits described below have received the most attention.\\n\\n=== reasoning, problem solving ===\\n\\nearly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. by the late 1980s and 1990s, ai research had developed methods for dealing with.\\n\\nthese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems, because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.  in fact, even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early ai research was able to model. they solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgements.\\n\\n=== knowledge representation ===that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). such formal knowledge representations can be used in content-based indexing and retrieval,among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:\\n;identified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that ai researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. ai research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.\\n;the breadth of commonsense knowledge: the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of—they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time. \\n;the subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. for example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\"these are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain. knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. as with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped thatwill provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.\\n\\n=== planning ===intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them. they need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the(or \"value\") of available choices.\\n\\nin classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions. however, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. this calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions, but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment..\\n\\n=== learning ===machine learning, a fundamental concept of ai research since the field\\'s inception,\\'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: \"a computer program is set to learn from an experience \\'\\'e\\'\\' with respect to some task \\'\\'t\\'\\' and some performance measure \\'\\'p\\'\\' if its performance on \\'\\'t\\'\\' as measured by \\'\\'p\\'\\' improves with experience \\'\\'e\\'\\'.\"the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. the agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.\\n\\n=== natural language processing ===, mittal et al., ijiids, 5(2), 119–142, 2011\\n and|journal=ieee computational intelligence magazine|date=may 2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=48–57|doi=10.1109/mci.2014.2307227}}\\n\\n=== perception ===is the ability to analyze visual input. such input is usually ambiguous;

research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. in all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. the time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. in contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about ethics.\"machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine

symbolism such as formal logic if an otherwise healthy adult has a fever then they may have that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to reinforce connections that seemed to be useful these four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems for example neural nets can learn to make inferences to generalize and to make analogies some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches alongside many other ai and nonai algorithmslearning algorithms work on the basis that strategies algorithms and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future these inferences can be obvious such as since the sun rose every morning for the last 10000 days it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well they can be nuanced such as x of many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it

permit because they advocated violence a generic ai has difficulty inferring whether the councilmen or the demonstrators are the ones alleged to be advocating violence problems nnnthe overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attentionnn reasoning problem solving nnearly researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late 1980s and 1990s ai research had developed methods for dealing withnnthese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a combinatorial explosion they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger  in fact even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research was able to model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgementsnn knowledge representation that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain field of interest or area of concern such formal knowledge representations can be used in contentbased indexing and retrievalamong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation arenidentified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem for any commonsense rule that ai researchers care to represent there tend to be a huge number of exceptions almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires ai research has explored a number of solutions to this problemnthe breadth of commonsense knowledge the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of—they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time nthe subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally for example a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposedthese are nonconscious and subsymbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain knowledge like this informs supports and provides a context for symbolic conscious knowledge as with the related problem of subsymbolic reasoning it is hoped thatwill provide ways to represent this kind of knowledgenn planning intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them they need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize theor value of available choicesnnin classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions however if the agent is not the only actor then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty this calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessmentnn learning machine learning a fundamental concept of ai

on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines in all cases only human beings have engaged in ethical
