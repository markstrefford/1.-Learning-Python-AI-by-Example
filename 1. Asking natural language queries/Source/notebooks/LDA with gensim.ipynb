(a generic ai has difficulty inferring whether the councilmen or the demonstrators are the ones alleged to be advocating violence.) == problems ==\\n\\n\\nthe overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. the general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. the traits described below have received the most attention.\\n\\n=== reasoning, problem solving ===\\n\\nearly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. by the late 1980s and 1990s, ai research had developed methods for dealing with .\\n\\nthese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems, because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.  in fact, even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early ai research was able to model. they solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgements.\\n\\n=== knowledge representation ===   that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). such formal knowledge representations can be used in content-based indexing and retrieval, among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:\\n; identified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that ai researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. ai research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.\\n;the breadth of commonsense knowledge: the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of —they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time. \\n;the subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. for example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\" these are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain. knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. as with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.\\n\\n=== planning ===  intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them. they need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the (or \"value\") of available choices.\\n\\nin classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions. however, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. this calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions, but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment. .\\n\\n=== learning === machine learning, a fundamental concept of ai research since the field\\'s inception, \\'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: \"a computer program is set to learn from an experience \\'\\'e\\'\\' with respect to some task \\'\\'t\\'\\' and some performance measure \\'\\'p\\'\\' if its performance on \\'\\'t\\'\\' as measured by \\'\\'p\\'\\' improves with experience \\'\\'e\\'\\'.\" the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. the agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.\\n\\n=== natural language processing ===    , mittal et al., ijiids, 5(2), 119–142, 2011\\n and |journal=ieee computational intelligence magazine|date=may 2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=48–57|doi=10.1109/mci.2014.2307227}}\\n\\n=== perception ===   is the ability to analyze visual input. such input is usually ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the ai to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its \"object model\" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.\\n\\n=== motion and manipulation === ai is heavily used in for millions of years. === social intelligence ===  moravec\\'s paradox can be extended to many forms of social intelligence. in the long run, social skills and an understanding of human emotion and s are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; this tends to give naive users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are. === general intelligence === historically, projects such as the cyc knowledge base (1984–) and the massive japanese may someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges. many of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence, if machines are to solve the problems as well as people do. for example, even specific straightforward tasks, like \", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\\n\\n== approaches ==\\nthere is no established unifying theory or ?\\ncan intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as )? or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?\\n\\n=== cybernetics and brain simulation === in the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between in england. by 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\\n\\n=== symbolic === when access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, ai research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. the research was centered in three institutions: .\\nresearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with and considered this the goal of their field.\\n\\n==== cognitive simulation ====\\neconomist architecture in the middle 1980s.\\n\\n==== logic-based ====\\nunlike simon and newell, .\\n\\n==== anti-logic or scruffy ====\\nresearchers at ) are an example of \"scruffy\" ai, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.\\n\\n====knowledge-based====\\nwhen computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build ), the first truly successful form of ai software. the knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple ai applications.\\n\\n=== sub-symbolic ===\\nby the 1980s progress in symbolic ai seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially . a number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific ai problems. sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.\\n\\n==== embodied intelligence ====\\nthis includes : the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\\n\\nwithin , developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.). ====computational intelligence and soft computing====\\ninterest in .\\n\\n=== statistical learning ===\\nmuch of traditional gofai got bogged down on \\'\\'ad hoc\\'\\' patches to symbolic computation that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. however, around the 1990s, ai researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as . in agi research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into gofai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence. === integrating the approaches ===\\n;intelligent agent paradigm: an and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents. building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. the intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.\\n\\n; s that include both symbolic and

real-world problems: the supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies. heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size. a very different kind

simplest ai applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many ai systems. to determine a closest match. they can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in ai. these examples are known as observations or patterns. in supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. a class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. when a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.\\n\\na classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and , ,  (svm),   === artificial neural networks ===  neural networks, or neural nets, were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. a simple \"neuron\" \\'\\'n\\'\\' accepts input from multiple other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), cast a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron \\'\\'n\\'\\' should itself activate. learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \" in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015. the study of

how can we ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically?\\n# can a machine have a ally cause harm?\\n\\n=== the limits of artificial general intelligence === can a machine be intelligent? can it \"think\"?\\n\\n;\\'\\' .\\n\\n;\\'\\'the \\'\\': \"every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\" this conjecture was printed in the proposal for the dartmouth conference of 1956, and represents the position of most working ai researchers.\\n\\n;\\'\\' .)\\ndreyfus criticized the

moral reasoning ===\\n\\nwidespread use of artificial intelligence could have , among others, described some short-term research goals to see how ai influences the economy, the laws and ethics that

intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. research in this area includes \"machine ethics\", \"artificial moral agents\", and the study of \"malevolent vs. friendly ai\".\\n\\n==== existential risk ====  a common concern about the development of artificial intelligence is the potential threat it could pose to humanity. this concern has recently gained attention after mentions by celebrities including the late a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible ai development. the opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable ai.{{cite journal\\n |last1       = müller\\n |first1      = vincent c.\\n |last2       =

humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.\\n\\nfor this danger to be realized, the hypothetical ai would have to overpower or out-think all of humanity, which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching. concern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high-profile donations and investments. in january 2015, to \"just keep an eye on what\\'s going on with artificial intelligence. development of militarized artificial intelligence is a related concern. currently, 50+ countries are researching battlefield robots, including the united states, china, russia, and the united kingdom. many people concerned about risk from superintelligent ai also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers. ==== devaluation of humanity ====  ). to weizenbaum these points suggest that ai research devalues human life.\\n\\n==== decrease in demand for human labor ==== the relationship between automation and employment is complicated. while automation eliminates old jobs, it also creates new jobs through micro-economic and macro-economic effects.e mcgaughey, \\'will robots automate your job away? full employment, basic income, and economic democracy\\' (2018) and others go further and argue that a large number of jobs are routine, repetitive and (to an ai) predictable; ford warns that these jobs may be automated in the next couple of decades, and that many of the new jobs may not be \"accessible to people with average capability\", even with retraining. economists point out that in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but acknowledge that \"we\\'re in uncharted territory\" with ai. ==== artificial moral agents ====\\nthis raises the issue of how ethically the machine should behave towards both humans and other ai agents. this issue was addressed by wendell wallach in his book titled \\'\\'moral machines\\'\\' in which he introduced the concept of (ama).wendell wallach (2010). \\'\\'moral machines\\'\\', oxford university press. for wallach, amas have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as \"does humanity want computers making moral decisions\"wallach, pp 37–54. and \"can (ro)bots really be moral\".wallach, pp 55–73. for wallach the question is not centered on the issue of \\'\\'whether\\'\\' machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the \\'\\'constraints\\'\\' which society may place on the development of amas.wallach, introduction chapter.\\n\\n==== machine ethics ==== the field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.michael anderson and susan leigh anderson (2011), machine ethics, cambridge university press. the field was delineated in the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethics: \"past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. in all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. the time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. in contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about ethics.\" machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. a variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition \"machine ethics\" that stems from the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethics.\\n\\n==== malevolent and friendly ai ==== political scientist believes that ai can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent. he argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\" humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no \\'\\'a priori\\'\\' reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which ais would not share). hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop. this topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet earth.\\n\\nphysicist \". one proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent ai is \\' \\', and will then be able to control subsequently developed ais. some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place.\\n\\nleading ai researcher writes, \"i think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent ai anytime in the next few hundred years. i think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of ai, and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\" === machine consciousness, sentience and mind === if an ai system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be .\\n\\n==== consciousness ====  ==== computationalism and functionalism ==== computationalism is the position in the .\\n\\n==== strong ai hypothesis ==== the philosophical position that john searle has named argument, which asks us to look \\'\\'inside\\'\\' the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.\\n\\n==== robot rights ====  \\'\\'. === superintelligence === are there limits to how intelligent machines\\xa0– or human-machine hybrids\\xa0– can be? a superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. ‘’superintelligence’’ may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.\\n\\n==== technological singularity ==== if research into \". technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable. s will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.\\n\\n====

devices since antiquity. the implications of a constructed machine exhibiting artificial intelligence have been a persistent theme in . he subsequently explored these in his many books, most notably

strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to reinforce connections that seemed to be useful these four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems for example neural nets can learn to make inferences to generalize and to make analogies some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches alongside many other ai and nonai algorithms  learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies algorithms and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future these inferences can be obvious such as since the sun rose every morning for the last 10000 days it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well they can be nuanced such as x of  many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a

problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attentionnn reasoning problem solving nnearly researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late 1980s and 1990s ai research had developed methods for dealing with nnthese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a combinatorial explosion they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger  in fact even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research was able to model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgementsnn knowledge representation    that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain field of interest or area of concern such formal knowledge representations can be used in contentbased indexing and retrieval among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation aren identified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem for any commonsense rule that ai researchers care to represent there tend to be a huge number of exceptions almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires ai research has explored a number of solutions to this problemnthe breadth of commonsense knowledge the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of —they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time nthe subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally for example a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposed these are nonconscious and subsymbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain knowledge like this informs supports and provides a context for symbolic conscious knowledge as with the related problem of subsymbolic reasoning it is hoped that will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledgenn planning   intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them they need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the or value of available choicesnnin classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions however if the agent is not the only actor then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty this calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment nn learning  machine learning a fundamental concept of ai research since the fields inception s widely quoted definition of machine learning a computer program is set to learn from an experience e with respect to some task t and some performance measure p if its performance on t as measured by p improves with experience e the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem spacenn natural language processing      mittal et al ijiids 52 119–142

ambiguous a giant fiftymetertall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normalsized pedestrian requiring the ai to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations for example by using its object model to assess that fiftymeter pedestrians do not existnn motion and manipulation  ai is heavily used in for millions of years  social

principles or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision makingmichael anderson and susan leigh anderson 2011 machine ethics cambridge university press the field was delineated in the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethics past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines in all cases only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning the time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy necessitate this in contrast to computer hacking software property issues privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence further investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories advancing our thinking about ethics machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality computational ethics or computational morality a variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition machine ethics that stems from the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethicsnn malevolent

malevolence humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality which has evolved along with our particular biology which ais would not share hyperintelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult

introduction chapternn machine ethics  the field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision makingmichael anderson and susan leigh anderson  machine ethics cambridge university press the field was delineated in the aaai fall  symposium on machine ethics past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines in all cases only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning the time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy necessitate this in contrast to computer hacking software property issues privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence further investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories advancing our thinking about ethics

that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality which has evolved along with our particular biology which ais would not share hyperintelligent software may not necessarily decide to support
